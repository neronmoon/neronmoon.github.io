I am DevOps and backend developer from Kaliningrad, Russia 🇷🇺

I adore technologies and building new things out of them. My web background has given me a solid 
experience in designing systems from scratch and scale them, quickly adapting to the crazy world, 
thinking a few steps ahead and do what is needed to get things done.

I always try to keep up with the latest trends, but I prefer to build things as simple as possible, 
because this is the only way they can evolve into something bigger.
